# 📊 Extrovert vs Introvert Behavioural Pattern

This project analyzes behavioural differences between **Extroverts** and **Introverts** based on key social variables like posting frequency, social event attendance, time spent alone, and friends circle size. I used **Excel** for data cleaning and **Tableau Public** for building the dashboard and visualizations.

## 🧼 Data Cleaning

Before visualizing, I cleaned the dataset using **Excel**:

- Rounded all decimal values to **0 decimal places** for consistency  
- Trimmed **leading and trailing whitespaces** from all columns  
- Checked for and highlighted **duplicates** before removing any  
- Verified all columns were in the right data format before importing into Tableau

## 📌 Dashboard Overview

The dashboard is made up of several key charts exploring patterns across both personality types:

### 1. **Going Outside**
Extroverts tend to go outside more frequently. Their numbers stay relatively high even at higher values, while introverts' activity drops off quickly after just a few outings.

---

### 2. **Post Frequency**
Introverts show a **sharp peak at 0–2 posts**, which means many of them are not very active in terms of posting online.  
However, this might not mean they’re offline — just that they prefer to **observe** rather than engage.  
On the other hand, extroverts post **more consistently across higher frequencies**, indicating stronger **outward engagement**.

---

### 3. **Time Spent Alone**
Introverts spend **more time alone** — no surprise there. They dominate the higher time-alone categories, while extroverts are more frequent in the lower ranges.

---

### 4. **Friends Circle Size**
Extroverts generally have **larger friend circles**, while introverts tend to keep theirs smaller. The numbers show extroverts are strongly present in the mid-to-high friend range, while introverts dominate the lower end.

---

### 5. **Social Event Attendance**
Extroverts attend **more social events** overall. Introverts are heavily clustered in the low-attendance range (0–2), while extroverts show up more in the mid to high ranges.

---

### 6. **Personality Split**
The dataset is fairly balanced with a **51.4% Extrovert** and **48.6% Introvert** distribution — making comparisons more meaningful and unbiased.

---

## 💡 Key Insights

- **Introverts are not necessarily offline** — they just engage differently, often passively.
- **Post frequency doesn’t tell the whole story**: introverts might scroll, read, or observe without interacting.
- **Extroverts are more visibly active** — from posting more often to attending events and maintaining larger social circles.
- These trends align with general personality behavior theories and offer a clear visual breakdown of social differences.

## ✅ Summary

This project helped me practice **data cleaning in Excel** and **storytelling with Tableau**. It also provided interesting insights into how personality types can influence digital and social behavior.
